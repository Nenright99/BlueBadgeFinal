Mission statement: to provide users with access to a variety of information on a large catalog of movies. How to install: Go to our github repository and clone the solution to your computer. Running the code through your IDE will allow you to access the API, where the URL can be copied and accessed through applications like postman. How is it used: The first step is to create your own account within the API, and using the custom token, access the various endpoints of the API to add movies or theatres (theaters) and then review/rate them. Endpoints: For each data table there are a variety of methods that can be used to alter the database through the REST model. Databased include: Theatres, Movies, Reviews, Ratings. Each database has standard endpoints for GET, CREATE, PUT, and DELETE that can be seen in the API documentation. To see the detailed endpoints, run the API through your preferred browser, then select the API header. Here the endpoints are all clearly labeled, and selecting a specific one will show which details are required to use the accompanying method. Contributers: This API was created by - Beatrice Saunders, Nathan Arnold, Mike Miles, and Nick Enright.
